# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
(Not to be confused with a WordPress framework – [Redux Framework](https://redux.io))

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).

You can use Redux together with [React](https://reactjs.org), or with any other view library.
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.

## Installation

[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

```
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

For the Redux core library by itself:

```
npm install redux
```

For more details, see [the Installation docs page](https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation).

## Learn Redux

### Redux Essentials Tutorial

The [**Redux Essentials tutorial**](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts) is a "top-down" tutorial that teaches "how to use Redux the right way", using our latest recommended APIs and best practices. We recommend starting there.

### Redux Fundamentals Tutorial

The [**Redux Fundamentals tutorial**](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview) is a "bottom-up" tutorial that teaches "how Redux works" from first principles and without any abstractions, and why standard Redux usage patterns exist.

### Additional Tutorials

- The Redux repository contains several example projects demonstrating various aspects of how to use Redux. Almost all examples have a corresponding CodeSandbox sandbox. This is an interactive version of the code that you can play with online. See the complete list of examples in the **[Examples page](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples)**.
